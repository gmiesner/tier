# MSTier: Tier rank MS&T classes

A clone of kat's [project](https://github.com/katmh/mitier), altered to be for missouri university of science and technology classes! 

## Installation

This is a Next.js (React) app using NPM. It's all client-side except for an [API route](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) (see `/pages/api`) that filters the courses dataset.

```
git clone https://github.com/katmh/mitier
cd mitier
npm install
npm run dev
```
